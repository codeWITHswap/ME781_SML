###  Object Detection Model
***

This model detects and segments relevant components (by creating bounding boxes) from an image. For this, we have fine-tuned the **RetinaNet** with **ResNet50** backbone architecture on our custom dataset. For the sake of this project, we focused on (1) image inputs and (2) single class detection : pump impeller with the assumption that every image can atmost have one pump impeller.
